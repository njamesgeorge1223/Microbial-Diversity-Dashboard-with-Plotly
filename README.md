# Belly Button Challenge
----
In this Challenge, I build an interactive dashboard, the [Microbial Diversity Dashboard](https://njgeorge000158.github.io/belly-button-challenge/), to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity data set, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

To see the Dashboard in action, run the HTML file, index.html, with any browser, but make sure that the files in ./static/js are available.
